My name is Priya Raja. I'm from Pune,India. I completed my Bachelors of Engineering in Information Technology in the year 2013. I joined as a junior software Engineer
in Addteq software in Pune, India in the same year. I was selected as the only 1 candidate out of 100 candidate who cam for the interview. I gave 7 rounds of interview as a fresher.
In Addteq I worked as a automation engineeer and on the company website in jQuery. I learned perl, groovy and python script for automation.
Then I moved to Dubai after marriage and took a break for 5 years. In these 5 years I took Data science courses from Coursera. I learned Python,react, node js, Javascript,
Sql, MongoDB, Postgresql. Then I started working as Front end Developer in e-zest solutions in 2021 Feb - 2022 December. I was proud to be again back after a long break and cracking the interview during covid times.
Then I joined Excellence driving in Dubai in the year 2023 January as a Frontend Dev. Here I expanded my role as a full stack developer. 
Worked on Node js, microservices, gRPC, React, Next js, Strapi CMS,MongoDB, docker. After 2.7 years of working I took a short break to get into AI.
As its the future and I was really ver interested in learning as I already knew Python and Data Science. I took up Udemy courses by Ed Donner. Read white papers, you tube videos by Andrej Karpathy.
Built projects in RAG, learned to deploy to AWS, GCP, Vercel and posting my progress in Linkedin regularly.
So that's it about me. Always learning and upskilling. Small steps each day and never giving up.
